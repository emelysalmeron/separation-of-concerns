</details>

### `npm run test -- path/to/file.spec.js`

You can run tests in this repository using the `test` script, it will run all the tests in the path you provide.

If you do `npm run test` or `npm run test -- ./` it will run every test in this repository. (there are a lot)

### `npm run document -- path/to/src`

> Pro Tip: do not use `npm run document` without a specific path, it is very slow!

This script will build a dependency graph for all the JavaScript files inside a specific `/src` folder. It can be very helpful to run the document script every time you add/remove a file or change the `import`/`export`s in an exercise.

If you run this script at a higher directory, like `./`, it will document all of the `/src` folders inside that directory.

### `npm run format -- path`

This script will format all of the code in the path you provide.

### Linting

There is no linting script in this repository. It's for practice only, no need to check every detail. Your project starter repositories will have linting scripts.

## Study Tips

- Don't rush, understand! Programming is hard.
  - The examples and exercises will still be there to study later.
  - It's better to fail tests slowly and learn from your mistakes than to pass tests quickly and not understand why.
- Don't skip the examples! Understanding and experimenting with working code is a very effective way to learn programming.
- Practice [Pair Programming](https://study.hackyourfuture.be/collaborating/pair-programming): two people, one computer.
- Take a look through the [Learning From Code](https://study.hackyourfuture.be/learning/learning-from-code) guide for more study tips

### Priorities

If you can't finish all the material in this repository, that's expected! Anything you don't finish now will always be waiting for you to review when you need it. These 3 emoji's will help you prioritize your study time and to measure your progress:

- ü•ö `:egg:` - Understanding this material is required, it covers the base skills you'll need for this module and the next. You do not need to finish all of them but should feel comfortable that you could with enough time.
- üê£ `:hatching_chick:` - Do your best to start this material. you don't need to master it or finish it but getting the main idea will be helpful for taking the next steps.
- üê• `:hatched_chick:` - Have you finished all the ü•ö's and started all the üê£'s? push yourself with these challenges.

### Hashtags

There's sooo many examples and exercises in this repository, it's easy to forget of what you still need to finish or what you want to review again. Luckily VSCode is really good at searching through folders of code.

You can write hashtags in your comments while you're studying, then search for those hashtags later so you don't miss anything. Here's some ideas:

- `// #not-done, still a few blanks left` - search for `#not-done` in VScode to find all the exercises you've started and not finished
- `// coercion is confusing, #review this again next week` - search for `#review` to find the files you need to study again
- ... anything goes! Find the hashtags that work for you

### Module Project Boards

If you create a fork of this repository you can open a project board in your fork to track your progress through the module. Just 3 columns can be enough: _Todo_, _Doing_, _Done_.

## Learning Objectives

What you can expect to learn in this module

<details>
<summary>expand/collapse</summary>

### Isolating JavaScript

- Creating DOM elements
- Reading & writing from DOM element properties
  - `.innerHTML`
  - `.value`
  - `.style`
  - ...
- Attaching event listeners to DOM objects
- Writing _event handlers_
  - Using `Event` objects as parameters
  - Structuring user interactions in handler functions
- Using template strings to create HTML strings

### Integrating JavaScript

- Document Life-Cycle
  - `<head>`: Scripts & styles are loaded top to bottom, before the `<body>`
  - `<body>`: Everything is executed/loaded top to bottom
  - so what? Any DOM script should be written/loaded _below_ the element it interacts with
- JS & the DOM
  - Adding event listeners to the DOM by `id`
  - Reading & Writing values from DOM elements
  - Using HTML strings and `.innerHTML` to update the DOM
  - Using template literal strings to render HTML
  - The beginnings of DOM manipulation
- Handling events:
  - Reading user data from events
  - Implementing user stories with this data
- Organizing your code based on it's _role_ in your program
  1. _DOM_: define the structure of your user interface
  2. _Styles_: define the display of your user interface
  3. _Event Listeners_: define _how_ users will interact with your program
  4. _Handlers_: define _what_ happens when a user interacts with your program
  5. _Logic_: define & test how user data is transformed
- Incremental Development 2.0:
  - Develop your projects one user-story at a time ...
  - AND develop your user stories one step at a time!
  - Carefully complete & test one piece of code before writing the next

## About the Projects

> template project for this module: [separation-of-concerns-starter](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/separation-of-concerns-starter)

Projects in this module will be more challenging than in the last modules, adding even a little interactivity into a website will make things much more complicated! To help you deal with this complexity you will practice separating and organizing your JavaScript code into different files based on what role it plays in your application.

<details>
<summary>expand/collapse</summary>

### Interactive UI

You will learn how to create interactive User Interfaces by reading and writing from the DOM:

- Users will pass input to your programs directly from the UI (no more `prompt`)
- Users will see results displayed directly in the UI (no more `alert`)

Projects in this module will not include full DOM manipulation, you'll learn that in the next module. This module's projects will be limited to reading/writing `.innerHTML` & `.value`.

### Decoupled Code

In this module you will learn how to completely separate your JavaScript from your user interface. You will be using `.getElementById` and `.addEventListener` instead of the `onclick` attribute.

When using `onclick`, you need to write some JavaScript in your HTML - this is not a good practice because your UI and JavaScript are too interdependent. Using HTML `id`s and JavaScript _event listeners_ you can **decouple** your User Interface from the program logic.

### DOM Event Listeners

Web development is fundamentally _event driven_, this means things don't happen until a something else happens. In your previous projects the `prompt` didn't appear until the user clicked a button and a prompt appeared. You've probably noticed by now that this is a limiting way to write your programs. It's hard to gather interesting data from a user, and impossible to display it in a nice way.

You will learn how to use _DOM events_ to interact with users and to read more interesting data than just a few words or numbers. Things like mouse movements, the colors on a screen, and much more.

### Separating your Concerns

A working project is not enough! For projects in this module we will expect you to turn in code that is well organized in different files based on it's role. The first week's project will come with some starter-code to help you get used to the folder structure we expect.

### Development Strategy

Just like in the previous module, you will be expected to explain your development strategy in a separate file called `development-strategy.md`. Projects involving JavaScript are naturally more complicated than projects with only HTML and CSS, for this reason you will need to have more types of task (`type: _`) in your `development-strategy`.

### Git Branching

In this module‚Äôs project you have many more files and folders, and you‚Äôre learning how to break a single feature into more smaller pieces. To implement a single user story you will need HTML, CSS, data, event listener(s), handler(s) and possibly a logic function or a procedure. All of these smaller tasks are pull together into one user story.

So a PR for one user story may have changes in many folders and files. At first this will feel like more work than necessary, but after a while you will start to see how this way of working makes larger projects easier to understand.

Good luck!

You do not need to study the event loop, you'll see that in Asynchronous Programming.

> individual project: [word-list](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/word-list)

This week's assignment is for learning how to work on a multi-file project. You will be using this project structure for the next few modules, so no worries if you don't understand everything right away. There's still plenty of time to understand.

There's only about 15-30 lines of JavaScript you need to write. That might not sound like it may not sound like a lot, but it will take some study to figure out what exactly to write where.

And the starter page is pretty ugly. Feel free to improve the HTML and CSS as much as you like! (just be careful not to break the id's ;)
